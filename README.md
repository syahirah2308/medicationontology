To run this program, you need an IDE> I use VS Code. 

Download the whole file. 

If you want to see the mapping of the ontology, you need to have Protege on your device and run the medicineOntologyRDF.owl file using Protege application. 

To view the systems, you just need to run the flask_app python file.
